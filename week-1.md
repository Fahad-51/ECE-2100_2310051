# Weekly Progress Report – Week 1  
**Project:** Online Pastry & Coffee Shop  
**Duration:** (01 February 2026) – (07 February 2026)

## 📌 Overview
During this week, I focused on learning and implementing the **backend authentication system using the MERN stack**. The goal was to understand secure user authentication, authorization, and email-based workflows, and to apply them in a practical backend application.

##  Backend Features Implemented

- User **Registration**
- User **Login** with JWT authentication
- **Email Confirmation** system
- **Welcome Email** after successful registration
- **Password Reset** functionality via email
- **Change Password** feature for authenticated users

🔐 **Security:**  
All user passwords are securely encrypted using **bcrypt** before being stored in the MongoDB database.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Google SMTP** – For email delivery  
- **Postman** – For API testing and validation  
- **MongoDB** – For database management  
- **Visual Studio Code** – Development environment
