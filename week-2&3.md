# Weekly Progress Report – Week 2 & Week 3

**Project:** Online Pastry & Coffee Shop  
**Duration:** 08 February 2026 – 21 February 2026  

---

## 📌 Overview

During **Week 2 and Week 3**, I completed the **full authentication system** of the project by integrating both **frontend and backend**.  
The main focus was to build a **secure and user-friendly authentication workflow**, ensuring proper validation, encrypted data storage, and **email-based verification using OTP**.

This phase involved implementing authentication features **end-to-end**, from user interface to database handling.

## 🔐 Authentication Features Implemented

### ✅ User Authentication
- User Registration  
- User Login  
- Forgot Password  
- Change Password using OTP  
- Account Verification using OTP  
- Welcome Email after successful registration

### 🔒 Security Measures
- All passwords are encrypted using **bcrypt**  
- OTP and sensitive fields handled securely  
- JWT-based authentication for protected routes  
- Secure database operations using **Mongoose**
